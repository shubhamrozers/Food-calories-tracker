# Food-calories-tracker
In  this project we can track calories of selected food item.

In this project, I reviewed the most important JavaScript concepts that I learned in course. Here's a list of some of these topics:

Data structures (numbers, strings, arrays, objects, arrays of objects) and their associated methods
    if conditions
    Iterations and Reduce
    Optional chaining & nullish coalescing
    Classes
    Fetch API and the FetchWrapper
    Modules & importing packages
    DOM (selection, events, etc.)
    Closures
    
I also learned how to:

integrate two 3rd party libraries: snackbar and chart.js
think about refactoring and DRY
refactor duplicate code
use classes to store application data/state
work with a generic API (Firebase API)
and much more!
